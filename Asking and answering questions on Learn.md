# Where can I ask a question about a lesson?

Questions can be asked by clicking the Ask a Question button at the top right of the page. The question feature notes what lab you are on and will ping any student who has set their questions feature to include the lesson you are on.

# How do I paste code in a question?

If you would like to paste code in a chat type ``` to open a code snippet. This is the best way to show someone your code in the chat, as it renders as code with the correct formatting, and it will be readable.

# Who sees my question?

Your question will reach everyone in the track who has completed the lesson associated with the question, unless a student has restricted what questions they see.

# How do I restrict which questions I receive notifications about?

Open the Ask a Question feature. Click the gear at the top right. From there you can toggle which questions you want to see. The setting options are to show questions for all previous lessons, the previous three lessons, and/or the next three lessons. 

# What is Learn’s method and philosophy for answering questions?

We strongly encourage students to answer questions and engage in dialogue. At Flatiron, we believe in the Socratic method for answering questions. In essence, lead each other to answers, don’t give away answers. Telling another student what to change in a line of code might be helpful to pass one lab, but the student will have missed out on learning a core concept. If you are jumping in to a question that someone is already answering, be aware of that. Offer assistance but try not to talk over each other as multiple answers and differing advice can be overwhelming.

# Am I expected to answer questions?

On Learn we value and encourage community learning. If you know the answer to a question, feel free to jump in and assist. Helping other students will strengthen your understanding of concepts, and collaborating with other Learners might teach you something new. Each time you join in a conversation on Learn you’ll earn a Karma point!

# When should I mark my question as resolved?

You should mark your question as resolved once your question has been answered, or once your active conversation has come to a close. Our hope with the “Ask a question” feature is that these chat rooms exist ephemerally to, as much as possible, address a question or issue a student is having about a particular lesson in real time. If you know you'll be inactive in the conversation for awhile, close the question. When you are ready you can always open another question if you still need assistance. That way the community and Learn Experts will be notified that you need help, and you will receive assistance faster. 

# What does Learn use Slack for?

We use Slack as a way for everyone in the community to chat casually. Slack is a good place to have conversations and learn more about one another. 

# Can I ask support questions in Slack?

We ask that you pose lab and lesson specific questions on Learn, for a couple of reasons. Our Learn Experts are on Learn, and will be able to assist you there, we’re not scanning Slack for questions or issues. Your question will have more reach on Learn, as not everyone in the Learn community is in the Slack channel (it tends to get noisy). By asking the question in Learn, everyone that has answered the question is pinged, and the question is automatically tagged with the associated lesson, making the context very clear.

# How do I get access to the Learn Slack?

Try searching for an invite in your email. You are automatically invited to Slack when you join the Learn Intro to Ruby track, and we've invited you with the email you used to sign up for Learn. If you can't track down that email, send an email to support@learn.co and we will resend an invitiation.

# What is Karma?

You get a Karma point when you contribute to a question asked on Learn. You only get the point once the question has been closed. You should strive to contribute something meaningful to each conversation you participate in.
